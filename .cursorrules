# Global Cursor Rules

## File Organization

- **No standalone scripts in root directory**: Always place standalone scripts in appropriate subdirectories:

  - Use `scripts/` for utility scripts and tools
  - Use `tools/` for development/maintenance scripts
  - Use `examples/` for example usage scripts
  - Place tests in appropriate test directories

  This keeps the root directory clean and makes the project structure more maintainable.
