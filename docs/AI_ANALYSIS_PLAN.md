# Klavicle AI Analysis Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing AI-powered analysis capabilities for Klaviyo data in the Klavicle tool.

## Project Overview

The goal is to enhance the existing analysis capabilities by leveraging AI to provide deeper insights, more nuanced recommendations, and identify patterns that static analysis might miss. This implementation will cover all data types (campaigns, flows, lists) and include a unified analysis feature.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation and Base Implementation

1. **Create AIAnalyzer Base Class**
   - Implement a reusable base class for AI analysis
   - Support multiple AI providers (OpenAI/Anthropic)
   - Handle authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
   - Define standard response formats

2. **Integrate with CampaignAnalyzer**
   - Add data export methods to prepare campaign data for AI analysis
   - Implement AI-specific analysis methods
   - Update output formatting to display AI insights
   - Maintain backward compatibility with static analysis

### Phase 2: Extend to Other Data Types

3. **Integrate with FlowAnalyzer**
   - Add data export methods for flow data
   - Create flow-specific AI prompts
   - Implement result parsing and display

4. **Integrate with ListAnalyzer**
   - Add data export methods for list data
   - Create list-specific AI prompts
   - Implement result parsing and display

### Phase 3: CLI and Configuration

5. **Update CLI Commands**
   - Add `--ai` flag to all analyze commands
   - Update help documentation
   - Ensure graceful fallback to static analysis if AI is unavailable

6. **Add Configuration Options**
   - Create config commands for setting API keys and preferences
   - Support environment variables for API keys
   - Add model selection options
   - Implement usage tracking

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features

7. **Create Specialized Prompts**
   - Refine prompts for each data type to maximize insight quality
   - Incorporate industry best practices into prompts
   - Add support for user-specified analysis goals

8. **Implement Export/Import**
   - Add commands to export data for offline AI analysis
   - Support importing analysis results from files
   - Create batch processing capabilities for large accounts

### Phase 5: Unified Cross-Data Analysis

9. **Implement Holistic Analysis**
   - Create methods to collect and correlate data across all types
   - Develop specialized prompts for cross-entity analysis
   - Identify relationships between different data types
   - Generate strategic recommendations based on the entire Klaviyo account

10. **Advanced Visualizations**
    - Generate visualizations of cross-entity relationships
    - Create dashboards for holistic account performance
    - Support exporting unified analysis to various formats

## Data Types and Analysis Focus

### Campaign Analysis
- Performance trends across campaigns
- Subject line effectiveness
- Send time optimization
- Content and strategy recommendations
- A/B testing suggestions

### Flow Analysis
- Flow efficiency and conversion analysis
- Timing and sequence optimization
- Message content recommendations
- Trigger effectiveness
- Flow comparison and consolidation opportunities

### List Analysis
- Segmentation effectiveness
- Growth and engagement patterns
- List hygiene recommendations
- Subscriber value analysis
- Cross-list membership insights

### Unified Analysis
- Tag usage consistency across all entities
- Customer journey mapping
- Cross-channel effectiveness
- Strategic resource allocation
- Overall account health assessment

## Technical Implementation Details

### AIAnalyzer Class Structure

```python
class AIAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, provider="openai", api_key=None, model=None):
        # Initialize with configurable provider, model, etc.
        
    async def analyze_data(self, data_type, data, context=None):
        # Main analysis method
        
    def generate_prompt(self, data_type, data, context):
        # Create appropriate prompts based on data type
        
    def parse_response(self, response):
        # Convert AI response to structured format
        
    def format_insights(self, insights):
        # Format insights for display
```

### Example Prompts

Campaign Analysis:
```
You are analyzing Klaviyo campaign data for an email marketing account.
The data includes metrics like open rate, click rate, and revenue.

Please provide:
1. Key performance insights
2. Anomalies or concerning campaigns
3. Subject line effectiveness patterns
4. Recommendations for improvement
5. Suggested tests or experiments
```

### Integration Points

Each analyzer class will be extended with:
- Data export methods
- AI analysis methods
- Results display methods

CLI commands will be updated to:
- Accept AI-specific flags
- Provide appropriate help text
- Handle errors gracefully

## Dependencies

- `openai` Python package for OpenAI API
- `anthropic` Python package for Claude API
- Additional visualization libraries as needed

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Users can get AI-powered insights for all data types
2. The analysis quality exceeds what's possible with static rules
3. The system gracefully handles API errors and limitations
4. Configuration is simple and flexible
5. Performance is acceptable for typical Klaviyo account sizes
6. Users can export/import data for offline analysis
7. The unified analysis provides strategic value beyond individual analyses
